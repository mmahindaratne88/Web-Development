This JavaScript code includes functionalities for Form Validation, Local Storage, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

1. Form Validation: When the form is submitted (taskForm.addEventListener("submit", ...)), it checks if the task title input is not empty before adding a new task. If the input is empty, it displays an alert message indicating that the task title cannot be empty.

2. Local Storage: The tasks are stored in the local storage using localStorage.setItem("tasks", JSON.stringify(tasks)), and they are retrieved from local storage during initialization using JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("tasks")). This allows tasks to persist even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.

3. CRUD Operations:
4. 
* Create: Adding a new task is done through the addTask(title) function, where a new task object is created and pushed into the tasks array.
* Read: Rendering tasks onto the webpage is done through the renderTasks() function, which iterates over the tasks array and dynamically creates HTML elements to display each task.   
* Update: Editing a task is performed through the editTask(index) function, which allows users to modify the title of an existing task. The updated tasks are then stored in local storage,      and the UI is re-rendered to reflect the changes.
* Delete: Deleting a task is handled by the deleteTask(index) function, which prompts the user for confirmation before removing the task from the tasks array. The updated tasks are then stored in local storage, and the UI is re-rendered to reflect the changes.

Overall, this JavaScript code effectively integrates Form Validation, Local Storage, and CRUD operations for managing tasks.
