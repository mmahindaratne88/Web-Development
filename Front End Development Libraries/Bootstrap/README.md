Bootstrap is a front-end framework used to design responsive web pages and applications. It takes a mobile-first approach to web development, meaning it prioritizes designing for smaller screens like those on mobile devices and then scales up for larger screens. Bootstrap includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, along with some JavaScript functionality, to streamline the process of creating visually appealing and responsive layouts.
