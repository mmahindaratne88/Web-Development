# Sass Overview

Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available in basic CSS, which make it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects.

## Variables

Sass allows the declaration of variables prefixed with the $ symbol. In this code, $primary-color and $border-radius are defined with specific color and numerical values respectively. These variables can then be reused throughout the stylesheet, enabling consistent styling.

## Nesting

Sass supports nesting of CSS rules inside one another, which helps to create more readable and maintainable stylesheets. In the .card block, styles for headings (h2) and paragraphs (p) are nested within the .card class, reducing repetition and improving readability.

## Mixins

Mixins in Sass allow the reuse of sets of CSS declarations. They are defined using @mixin followed by a name and a set of CSS properties. In this code, the transform mixin is defined to apply vendor prefixes for the transform property. It is then included in the .box class to apply a rotation transformation to the box.

Overall, Sass enhances CSS authoring by providing features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which facilitate more efficient and maintainable stylesheet development. When compiled, Sass preprocesses these features into standard CSS, making it compatible with all modern web browsers.
