# React Counter

This is a simple React counter application that allows users to increment and decrement a counter.

## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need a modern web browser that supports React, ReactDOM, and Babel.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

Once the application is loaded in the browser, you'll see a counter with two buttons: "Increment" and "Decrement". Clicking on the "Increment" button will increase the counter by 1, and clicking on the "Decrement" button will decrease the counter by 1.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- ReactDOM: A package that provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web application to interact with the DOM.
- Babel Standalone: A compiler for writing next generation JavaScript, which converts JSX syntax into plain JavaScript that browsers can understand.
