jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies various tasks like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. It was released in 2006 at a time when all major browsers handled JavaScript slightly differently, leading to inconsistencies in web development practices. jQuery addressed this issue by providing a unified and simplified API for interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) and handling events, animations, and AJAX requests.

This abstraction layer hid the browser-specific differences, allowing developers to write code that behaved consistently across different browsers. jQuery significantly simplified the process of writing client-side JavaScript and ensured that code worked the same way in all browsers, regardless of the underlying differences in JavaScript implementation.

- The HTML document is structured conventionally with meta tags, including charset and viewport settings, a title for the webpage, and a <script> tag importing the jQuery library from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

- There's a <style> block defining a CSS class .highlight, which sets the text color to red and makes it bold.

- Inside the <body> section, there's a paragraph (<p>) element containing sample text and a button (<button>) element with the id highlightBtn.

- The <script> block at the end of the document contains jQuery code. It selects the button with the id highlightBtn using jQuery's selector $('#highlightBtn') and attaches a click event handler to it using the click() function. When the button is clicked, the function inside the click() method is executed. This function selects all <p> elements on the page using $('p') and adds the CSS class highlight to them using .addClass('highlight').

In essence, this code demonstrates the usage of jQuery to enhance interactivity on a webpage. Specifically, it adds functionality to a button such that when clicked, it highlights all paragraphs on the page by applying a specific CSS class to them.
